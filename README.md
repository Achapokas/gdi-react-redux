# gdi-react-redux

## set-up
This workshop was created using npm 5.1.0 and node v8.1.2. Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) to install and manage different node versions.

Check what versions of node + npm you are running:
```sh
npm -v
node -v
```

If you are not running npm 5.1.0 and node v8.1.2, install node v8.1.2:
```sh
nvm install v8.1.2
```

Make sure you use the new version:
```sh
nvm use 8.1.2
```

Verify you are running the correct versions.
